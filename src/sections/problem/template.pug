        p= 'The design research for an iOS application started with ethnographic interviews with stakeholders from FemTechNet. Based on the information from the interviews, our team narrowed down the main problems into two issues: having too many different communication platforms and difficulties of maintaining the long-term involvement of students in the network. For instance, the complexity of having too many different communication platforms has driven some members out from the community. In addition, some studentsâ€™ networks are hard to maintain the long-term involvement as students tend to lose the connections and sense of belonging to FemTechNet.'
